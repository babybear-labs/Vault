# Vault

## Overview

Tokenized Vaults with API is a yield-bearing smart contract that automatically invests user deposits into DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound. The vault dynamically reallocates funds based on the best available yields to maximize returns. Users receive tokenized vault shares representing their deposits, ensuring transparency and efficiency.

## Goal

The goal is to create an automated and optimized yield aggregator that allows users to seamlessly deposit funds and earn interest without manually managing their allocations. This project enhances DeFi accessibility by reducing complexity for users while ensuring optimal yield generation.

### Features
- Supports dynamic rebalancing between protocols to handle changing interest rates.
- Ensures security & efficiency by implementing upgradeable smart contracts.
- Future enhancements may include multi-asset support and emergency withdrawal mechanisms for risk mitigation.
- Future enhancements may support drop in UI for interactions.
